# Operation-System
This GitHub repository contains the coursework for the **Operating System** course at Nankai University during the autumn semester of 2023. 
## Background
The overarching objective of this project is to port the `ucore`  to the 64-bit `RISC-V` instruction set architecture. This task is being undertaken incrementally, with each module constructed from scratch, ultimately resulting in the development of an operating system capable of running basic command-line functions. 
## Collaborators
